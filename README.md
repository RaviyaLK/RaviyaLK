### 🚀  What I Build
- **Eventix-AI-Event-Planner** — Autonomous multi-agent event planning system generating agendas, budgets, and reports using **LLMs + LangGraph + LangChain**.  
- **Codewhiz-Developer-Assistant** — A retrieval-augmented RAG assistant helping developers navigate SDKs, APIs, and technical documentation.  
- **Intellica-Research-Agent** — Multi-step **agentic AI** research assistant that searches, summarizes, and compiles structured reports with citations.  
- **Answerly** — Document Q&A platform built with **RAG** for context-aware querying across multiple PDFs.  
- **TripGenie-AI** — Conversational travel assistant powered by **FastAPI + Gemini + Amadeus API** with personalized recommendations.
- **Osteo-Vision** — Deep learning and explainable AI applied to knee osteoporosis diagnosis via X-ray.
